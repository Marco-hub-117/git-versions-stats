# Git Versions Stats
This repository contain four different script:
- analyzer.py used to extract source code from Git repository
- compareWithMoss.py used to send moss comparison between source code and to save the information retrieved into a csv file
- compareWithDiff.py used to do comparison based on the diff command between reformatted C source code
- heatMapGenerator.py used to visualize the csv file generated from the previous script into a heatmap

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to **install al**l required **packages**.

# analyzer.py 
<details><summary>analyzer.py used to extract source code from Git repository (Click to expand) </summary>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You need to install [pygit2](https://www.pygit2.org/install.html) package.

You can simply run `pip install pygit2` to do it

Here a list of possible command and option for analyzer.py

The following command show the **help** message: `python3 analyzer.py --help`

**usage**: analyzer.py [-h] [--workdir workdir] [--outputdir outdir] [--fileSearched [FILESEARCHED ...]]

- The option `--workdir workdir` ( -d is the short version of the command ) is used to specify the path containining the repository from wich to extract all commited file searched. (default is ".")

- The option `--outputdir outdir` ( -o is the short version of the command ) is used to specify the path that will contain the extracted source code (deafult is "./analyzerOutput"). The extracted source code name has the following format: `date-string_commit-hex_original-source-code-name`

- The option `[--fileSearched [FILESEARCHED ...]]` ( -fs is the short version of the command ) is used to specify the name of the file you need to extract from the repository. By default is "*.c", so the script will extract all *.c source code committed. The arguments must be enclosed into quotes .You can specify more than one file name, for example `analyzer.py --fileSearched '*.c' '*.py' 'file-testo.txt'` will search all committed file, that match one of the fileSearched argument, extracted from the git repository contained into '.' path, and will save them into ./analyzerOutput directory. In this example the script will extract all commited file that end with _.c_ and _.py_, and all committed files with the exact _file-testo.txt_ name

The following is a **summary example** for analyzer.py:

`python3 analyzer.py -d path-to-git-rep -o example-analyzer-output -fs '*.py'`

The following command will extract all the *.py source code commited into path-to-git-rep repository and will save them into example-analyzer-output directory

# compareWithMoss.py
<details><summary>compareWithMoss.py used to send moss comparison between source code and to save the information retrieved into a csv file (Click to expand)</summary>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This script use [Moss plagiarism detection](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) to perform the comparison. The moss requests are sends with [mosspy](https://github.com/soachishti/moss.py) package. 

To **install** this r**equired package** simply run `pip install mosspy`

Here a list of possible command and option for compareWithMoss.py

**usage**: `compareWithMoss.py [-h] [--firstdir firstdir] [--seconddir seconddir] [--outdir outdir]`

The following command show the **help** message: `python3 compareWithMoss.py --help`

The script compare all .c source code contained into first directory passed with all the .c source code contained into second directory passed, sending moss request and retrieving the result from the resulting moss web page. 

It will save the result into a **csv file** with the following **field**: 

- 'FILE_NAME_1', 'FILE_NAME_2', 'TIME_STAMP_1', 'TIME_STAMP_2', 'RESULT_URL', 'PERC_SIM_1 [%]', 'PERC_SIM_2 [%]', 'SIMILARITY [%]', 'LINES_MATCHES'

The **resulting csv** has the following **name** format: _firstDirName_secondDirName_moss.csv_

When the script start it search into output directory if a csv file with the same name is already present and ask if you want to overwrite that file; if you don't, the script automatically search into that csv file all missing comparison, start to send moss requests of this missing comparison and append the result into that csv file.

**usage**: `compareWithMoss.py [-h] [--firstdir firstdir] [--seconddir seconddir] [--outdir outdir]`

- The option `--firstdir firstdir` ( -f is the short version of the command ) is used to specify the first directory that contain c source code

- The option `--seconddir seconddir` ( -s is the short version of the command )is used to specify the second directory that contain c source code

- The option `--outdir outdir` ( -o is the short version of the command ) is used to specify the output directory that will contain the csv result file (Default = "./script_moss_compare")

# compareWithDiff.py

<details><summary>compareWithDiff.py used to do comparison based on the diff command between reformatted C source code (Click to expand)</summary>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here a list of possible command and option for compareWithDiff.py

**usage**: compareWithDiff.py [-h] [--firstdir firstdir] [--seconddir seconddir] [--outdir outdir]

The following command show the **help** message: `python3 compareWithDiff.py --help`

The script compare all .c source code contained into first directory passed with all the .c source code contained into second directory passed, using the diff command on reformatted source code.

The **resulting csv** has the following **name** format: _firstDirName_secondDirName_diff.csv_

It will save the result into a **csv file** with the following **field**:

- 'FILE_NAME_1', 'FILE_NAME_2', 'TIME_STAMP_1', 'TIME_STAMP_2', 'ADD_TOKENS', 'REMOVE_TOKENS', 'SUM_TOKENS', 'DIFF_WITH_MAX', 'SIMILARITY [%]'

DIFF_WITH_MAX is the difference between the maximum in the columnn SUM_TOKENS and the SUM_TOKENS value in the row.

SIMILARITY [%] is calculated through the ratio between DIFF_WITH_MAX value and the maximum in the columnn SUM_TOKENS multiplied by 100.

When the script start it search into output directory if a csv file with the same name is already present and ask if you want to overwrite that file.

**usage**: compareWithDiff.py [-h] [--firstdir firstdir] [--seconddir seconddir] [--outdir outdir]

- The option `--firstdir firstdir` ( -f is the short version of the command ) is used to specify the first directory that contain c source code

- The option `--seconddir seconddir` ( -s is the short version of the command )is used to specify the second directory that contain c source code

- The option `--outdir outdir` ( -o is the short version of the command ) is used to specify the output directory that will contain the csv result file (Default = "./diff_compare_result")

#  heatMapGenerator.py
<details><summary>heatMapGenerator.py used to visualize the csv file generated from the compareWithMoss.py script into a heatmap (Click to expand)</summary>

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You need to install [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/getting_started/index.html#installation-quick-start) and  [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/) packages.

You can simply run `pip install matplotlib` and `pip install numpy` to do it.

You may need to run `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` to show the pyplot figure gui.

**usage**: `heatMapGenerator.py [-h] [--filetoread filetoread] [--saveimage PATH-TO-SAVE-TO] [--imageformat IMAGE FORMAT]`

The following command show the **help** message: `python3 heatMapGenerator.py --help`

- the option `--filetoread filetoread` is used to specifiy the **csv file** you want to **read** to plot the heatmap

- the option `--saveimage PATH-TO-SAVE-TO` is used specify the **path** in wich **save** the result heatmap. If not specified, the script doesn't save the image

- the option `--imageformat IMAGE FORMAT` specify the format of the saved image. Choices are **png, svg, pdf**. Default = "png"

[Here](https://gitlab-rbl.unipv.it/source-code-analysis/git-versions-stats/-/tree/main/heatMapSavedImage/lim-160) you can find some example of resulting image.
